Mobile Recording
================

This folder contains Teensy firmware for in-wild recording and tools for converting the recorded data into useable formats. The converted data is used to emulate and display IV surfaces on the screen.

Sub-Directories
---------------

- ``converter`` Tool for converting raw data from SD card into ``.raw`` format.
- ``Teensy_firmware_mobile_record_revF`` Teensy firmware to record IV surfaces in the wild.

Usage
-----

To record IV surfaces in the wild, you need to follow below steps

#. Connect Ekho record board to Teensy 3.6.
#. Flash Teensy 3.6 with ``mobile_record_revF.ino`` code in ``Teensy_firmware_mobile_record_revF`` directory, using Arduino-teensy. In the code, change desired recording time by changing the value of ``RecordTime`` variable in miliseconds.
#. Make sure the power switch on Ekho record board is either on teensy to power Ekho record board from teensy, or on battery if you choose to (don't forget to connect a battery) .
#. Insert SD card into teensy and notice the led will be on while IV curves are being recorded and will turn off when the recording is completed. Note each curve needs 5128 bytes. So, make sure that you have enough space on the SD card.
#. Leave the recorder in the environment you want to capture IV surfaces for, and remove the SD  card after desired time.
#. To process the data from the SD card (stored in ``.sdraw`` format), connect the SD card to your computer, and run following.
    
``./convert <surface_file_name(output)> <sdraw_file_from_sdcard(input)>``

Both raw and regressed IV surfaces will be displayed on the screen.

| Note
- Run above command after compiling ``convert.cpp`` and ``generate_surface.cpp``. This can be done individually by compiling in their respective directories or in ekho software directory at once.
- Run ``make`` or ``make all`` to compile in any of the above directory of your choice.
- Use ``make clean`` or ``make remake`` if needed.

Following files will be generated after running ``convert.sh``

***.ivs**
    Regressed IV surface in unreadable format that can be used for emulation.

***.raw**
    Raw IV surface in unreadable binary format.

***.gnu**
    GNU plot code for plotting regressed IV surface.

***_raw.gnu**
    GNU plot code for plotting the raw(recorded) IV surface.
