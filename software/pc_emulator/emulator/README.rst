Emulating IV Surfaces
=====================

This folder contains tool for emulating IV surfaces.

To emulate IV surfaces when connected when connected to a PC, follow below steps

#. Connect Ekho emulator board to Teensy 3.6 ``A2 -> VSAMP``, ``GND -> GND``, ``A21 -> DAC``.
#. Ensure the dacamp.dat file in emulate.cpp is the correct map for the emulate board.
#. Flash Teensy 3.6 with ``pc_emulate_revE.ino`` code in ``Teensy_firmware_pc_emulate_revE`` directory, using Arduino-teensy.
#. Place a capacitor between emulator output ``LOAD`` and your load. I use 2.2 uF. 
#. Although the board has a 470 ohm sense resistor, you might need to remove it and replace it with a resistor that suits your recording. Place the sense resistor between ``LOAD_V+`` and ``AMPOUT`` pins on the emulator.  Also, change the variable ``RESISTANCE`` value in ``emulate.cpp`` to reflect the resistance that you are using.

    How to choose a sense resistor for a certain harvester? | 
    | > You need to know what the maximum voltage and current your harvester can produce (by plotting the recorded data). Suppose that your harvester produces maximum 4.15V and maximum 0.00004A current. Subtract maximum voltage of your harvester form the maximum voltage that Ekho recorder can record which is 10.30V and divide the result by the maximum current of your harvester (found by analyzing the output of the recording tools). (10.3-4.15)/0.00004 = 125K resistor.
    | > Now, you need to see the minimum current Ekho emulator produces based on the value of the sense resistor (125K). First, calculate the minimum voltage that can be produced by Ekho emulator = 3.3(maximum voltage of Teensy)* 3.2(opamp gains of Ekho recorder) /4096 (ADC value of 3.3 voltage) = 0.0025 volts. Second, divide this minimum voltage by the sense resistor= 0.0025V/125K = 0.00000002 Amp. 
    | > So, the minimum current can be played with using 125K sense resistor is 0.00000002 Amp. If your harvester produce less than that you need to pick another resistor value. 

#. To start emulating, and run following command
    
``./emulate <emulator_port> <path_to_ivs_file>``

#. Make sure emulator is powered by a 12V battery or power supply.
Keep following the output on the terminal

| Note
- Run above command after compiling emulate.cpp. This can be done by compiling it in ``emulator`` directory or in Ekho software directory. 
- The emulation program has a one second delay before beginning emulation.
- Run ``make`` or ``make all`` to compile in any of the above directory of your choice.
- Use ``make clean`` or ``make remake`` if needed.
